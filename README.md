Cafe Management System

This project implements a cafe management system using Java, JavaFX, Scene Builder, and NetBeans IDE on macOS. It streamlines cafe operations, allowing you to manage orders, customers, inventory, and finances effectively.

Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK): Download and install the latest JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/. Verify installation by running java -version in your terminal.
NetBeans IDE: Download and install NetBeans from https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/index.html. Choose the Java SE version that matches your JDK.
Project Setup

Create a New Project in NetBeans:

Open NetBeans IDE.
Go to "File" -> "New Project".
Select "Java" from the categories and "JavaFX Application" from the templates.
Give your project a name (e.g., "CafeManagementSystem") and choose a location to save it.
Click "Finish".
Design User Interface (UI) with Scene Builder:

In the Project Explorer window, right-click on the "src" package and select "New" -> "Other...".
Expand "JavaFX" and choose "FXML Document".
Name the file appropriately (e.g., "main.fxml"). Click "Finish".
Scene Builder will launch. Here, you can visually design the layout of your application's windows using drag-and-drop UI components.
Organize your UI elements (panes, buttons, text fields, labels, etc.) to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Use FXML properties to bind UI elements to Java code for interactive behavior.
Implement Application Logic in Java:

Create Java classes to represent entities like MenuItem, Order, Customer, and InventoryItem.
Develop methods for adding, editing, deleting, and displaying these entities in your application.
Write code to handle user interactions with the UI elements designed in Scene Builder using FXML controllers.
Utilize JavaFX classes like Stage, Scene, and Controller to manage the application's windows, UI elements, and event handling.
Employ Java database libraries (e.g., JDBC) to connect to a database for persistent data storage (optional, but recommended for real-world scenarios). Establish a connection pool for efficient database interactions.
Implement exception handling to gracefully handle errors and provide informative messages to the user.
Running the Application

Compile and Run:
In NetBeans, right-click on your project in the Project Explorer window and select "Run Project".
Features (to be implemented based on your specific requirements):

Order Management:
Create new orders.
Add, edit, and remove menu items from orders.
Calculate order totals (including taxes and discounts if applicable).
Track order status (e.g., pending, preparing, complete).
Customer Management:
Add, edit, and remove customer information.
Offer loyalty programs or discounts for returning customers.
Inventory Management:
Manage cafe inventory (ingredients, drinks, food items).
Track stock levels and generate low-stock alerts.
Implement functionality for adding and removing inventory items.
Financial Management:
Calculate daily/weekly/monthly sales reports.
Display profit margins and track expenses (optional).
Reporting:
Generate reports on sales, inventory, and other relevant data (optional).
Additional Considerations:
User authentication and authorization (if multiple users with different roles need to access the system).
Printing receipts or invoices.
Table reservation management (optional).

Customization and Expansion

This README provides a foundation. Feel free to tailor the application to your cafe's specific needs by adding new features, modifying existing ones, and customizing the UI.

Further Enhancements

Database Integration: For persistent data storage, consider using a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
Advanced UI Features: Explore advanced JavaFX layouts, charts, and graphics to create a visually appealing and informative interface.
Deployment: Package your application as a JAR file or standalone executable for distribution.
